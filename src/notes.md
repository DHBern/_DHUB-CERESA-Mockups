- `add` cannot be top-level. Instead use `insert` / however, inside substitution, it's `add` and not `insert`... this is a bit inconsistent or confusing.
- what is the difference between {added text} and ⌜added text⌟? full words vs. parts of words?

- `provveduto<insert type="hand" place="inline">&nbsp;</insert>a` This currently needs the `&nbsp;` to render in LF
- &#8209; for non-breaking hyphen.
- &nbsp; needed if correction includes whitespace at start or end: `È non<choice><sic>idem</sic><corr>&nbsp;dimen</corr></choice>o`
